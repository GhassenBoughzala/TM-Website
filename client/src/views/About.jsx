                      Launched in July 2021, the Taa Marbouta Language Centre is
                      a resource for language learning and professional
                      development. We are based in the beautiful seaside suburb
                      of Carthage in Tunisia, just two streets from the
                      Mediterranean Sea &#8211; so close that our students often
                      go swimming after class during the warmer months of the
                      year!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So why Tunisia? We believe that Tunisia provides great
                      opportunities to students around the world. Our teachers
                      are wonderful, the cost of living is relatively low, and
                      students can take their first steps in the international
                      arena with internships through us.

                  While providing quality language education and supporting
                  research and internships, we also want to bring the best of
                  what Tunisia has to offer to the world. All teachers at the
                  Taa Marbouta Language Centre are well-qualified and
                  experienced. They are also passionate and dedicated to making
                  sure your experience is both positive and effective. For those
                  interested in the study abroad and internship packages, our
                  team can help you with logistical arrangements if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are partnered with or on the study abroad list of several
                  of the top universities around the world. We are also
                  connected with various Tunisian non-governmental organisations
                  to provide internship opportunities for students, and Tunisian
                  businesses who provide discounted services to our students.
                  These businesses share our vision of a more engaged,
                  outward-looking Tunisia for the future, while we hope to do
                  our bit in the coming years to help Tunisians at home as well.

                  To ease the registration process we are able to accept
                  payments through our multi-currency bank account. This means
                  that you will not be hit by foreign exchange and transfer
                  fees, whether you are paying in US Dollars, Euros, Pounds, or
                  one of many other currencies. Our team is swift and
                  professional, and will help you focus on what matters most to
                  you &#8211; learning a language!

                  Students from over 20 countries have joined us for classes
                  since July 2021, from a variety of work backgrounds and life
                  experiences. We work most closely with universities in order
                  to support the language development of students from around
                  the world. We regularly seek out feedback from our students so
                  that we continue to grow and improve. Our average rating on
                  Google is 4.9/5.0 and over 95% of our students recommend the
                  Taa Marbouta Language Centre.
