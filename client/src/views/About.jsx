            We are partnered with or on the study abroad list of several of the
            top universities around the world. We are also connected with
            various Tunisian non-governmental organisations to provide
            internship opportunities for students, and Tunisian businesses who
            provide discounted services to our students. These businesses share
            our vision of a more engaged, outward-looking Tunisia for the
            future, while we hope to do our bit in the coming years to help
            Tunisians at home as well.

            To ease the registration process we are able to accept payments
            through our multi-currency bank account. This means that you will
            not be hit by foreign exchange and transfer fees, whether you are
            paying in US Dollars, Euros, Pounds, or one of many other
            currencies. Our team is swift and professional, and will help you
            focus on what matters most to you &#8211; learning a language!

            Students from over 20 countries have joined us for classes since
            July 2021, from a variety of work backgrounds and life experiences.
            We work most closely with universities in order to support the
            language development of students from around the world. We regularly
            seek out feedback from our students so that we continue to grow and
            improve. Our average rating on Google is 4.9/5.0 and over 95% of our
            students recommend the Taa Marbouta Language Centre.

                      Launched in July 2021, the Taa Marbouta Language Centre is
                      a resource for language learning and professional
                      development. We are based in the beautiful seaside suburb
                      of Carthage in Tunisia, just two streets from the
                      Mediterranean Sea &#8211; so close that our students often
                      go swimming after class during the warmer months of the
                      year!

                    <p>
                      So why Tunisia? We believe that Tunisia provides great
                      opportunities to students around the world. Our teachers
                      are wonderful, the cost of living is relatively low, and
                      students can take their first steps in the international
                      arena with internships through us.
