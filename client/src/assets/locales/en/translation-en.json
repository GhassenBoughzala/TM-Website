  "HomeT4": "Learn different Arabic Dialects",
  "HomeP4": "While formal Arabic provides an element of linguistic unity throughout the Arab world, dozens of dialects are spoken ‘on the street’ across the region. In reality, many dialects mix both Modern Standard Arabic and local terminology. At the Taa Marbouta Language Centre we teach the Tunisian and Libyan dialects, also known as Darija. Our experienced teachers will give you lessons and courses that are tailored to help you learn Tunisian Arabic and Libyan Arabic effectively. Group classes are available in-person at our centre in Carthage, Tunis, while private classes can be taken online or in-person.",
