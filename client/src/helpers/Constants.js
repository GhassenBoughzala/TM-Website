The three rooms are valued after three significant Arab writers of the twentieth century: Abulqassem Al-Chebbi, Mahmoud Darwish, and Nawal El-Saadawi. Our centre also has a kitchen and bathroom, a beautiful balcony, and sits next to the ancient Punic Port in historic Carthage, a UNESCO world heritage site on the Mediterranean Sea. Students are welcome to use available spaces at the centre outside of their class times; it is a safe, comfortable environment for Tunisians and international students alike. Sitting outside on our branded beanbags on the balcony in the sun has been very popular amongst students over the past few years! ",

    desc: "The Taa Marbouta Language Centre is driven by flexibility, which means our classes are able to start with just two students. At the same time, progress and effective learning is of the utmost importance to us, and so we limit classes to a maximum of eight students. Unless students have zero experience with a language (starting from scratch, ab initio), we ask everyone to complete a relatively quick placement test before coming so that we can place people into groups that are appropriate for their level. Group classes allow students to build confidence gradually, learn from the mistakes of their peers, and make friends along the way.",

We also occasionally have sessions in other interesting languages or dialects, such as Hebrew and Tamazight.

Intensive classes generally last for four hours per day and take place in either the morning or afternoon, with short breaks built in to keep everyone fresh. While groups classes take place at our language centre in Carthage, online sessions can be arranged via Zoom for private study.",

We ask that students do not open laptops or use their phones during classes as these distract not only the student, but also the students sitting around them. We ensure that regular breaks are built into the classes so that students can recharge and refresh regularly.",

This will include historical and cultural sites around Tunis, and occasionally visits to other parts of the country.

We can connect you with host families and young professionals so that you can maximise the chances of having a fully immersive experience in Tunisia, which can contribute enormously to your language development and knowledge of Tunisian culture. In addition to such homestays, students can live alone in a studio or one-bedroom apartment, live with other Taa Marbouta students in a two-, three-, or more bedroom villa, and students can also find shared apartments on the numerous social media groups in Tunisia that advertise rooms.    ",

These can be in the neighbourhood around the Taa Marbouta Language Centre, or in another neighbourhood that can be reached via public transport. If you would prefer to live with young Tunisians, including students, we can also try to connect you to the right people. The Taa Marbouta Language Centre is located in the suburb of Carthage, one of the safest, wealthiest and most beautiful neighbourhoods in the country.",

For those on a tighter budget, Carthage can be reached via metro/train from downtown and other neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods are all very close to beaches, have numerous cafes, restaurants, and bars, and are vibrant during the summer months. They are also safe and provide lots of opportunities for students to mingle with Tunisians of a similar age.",
  },
  {
    desc: "For students staying in Tunisia in the summer we recommend making sure either air conditioning or a fan is provided as it can get over 40 degrees celsius at that time of year. Otherwise, a key thing to check is if a security deposit needs to be paid. This is always the case when renting through an agency and is probably not worth the hassle if a student is only staying in Tunisia for 4-8 weeks.",
  },
  {
    desc: "Unless a student’s home institution is paying the Taa Marbouta Language Centre to also cover accommodation needs in Tunisia, it will be up to the student to find accommodation. We are happy to point students in the right directions and suggest a limited number of places where previous Taa Marbouta students have had happy stays; however, for the most part we will have a very limited role in your accommodation as our focus is on providing quality education.   ",

Cheaper options are available but only if you first book a hotel or AirBnB for the first week and then spend that week searching for local accommodation. It is possible to find options as low as TND 500 per month, in this case for longer-term stays. If you are staying for a short period of time over the summer you may find it difficult to find options for less than TND 1,500 per month.",

The airport is located inside the city and so is just a few minutes drive from the Taa Marbouta Language Centre. Airlines that fly here include : Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, Transavia, Nouvelair, and TunisAir (although we suggest you avoid TunisAir if possible as delays are inevitable). If you are looking for cheap flights we recommend keeping an eye on Transavia and Nouvelair.",
  },
  {
    desc: "You can also fly to Enfidha Airport near Hammamet. This is around an hour from Tunis and you can fly there from additional destinations with Easyjet and TUI. This is certainly worth looking at, although please note we will not be able to collect you from the airport (we can try to facilitate an airport pickup though).",
  },
  {
    desc: "Flights to the UK take less than three hours and flights to the Gulf take around five and a half hours. You can take taxis from the airport. They tend to be expensive with no fixed fares, so we suggest you keep us informed of your arrival (and share your flight number and flight details) and we can try to arrange a pick-up from the airport. We suggest you exchange money at the airport , as it is not easy to get Tunisian Dinars outside the country (GBP 1 = approx. TND 3.8, USD 1 = approx. TND 3.15). You can also buy a sim card for your phone at the airport from one of the major phone companies: Ooreedoo, Orange, Tunisie Telecom. They are all equally good.",

  {
    desc: "Any EU nationals arriving in Tunis will receive a stamp upon arrival in their passport. This entitles you to stay for three months in Tunisia before having to leave the country or formally extend your stay. Nationals of the US, Canada, Australia, UK and New Zealand can also remain in Tunisia for three months on the same terms. If you are from another country please let us know so that we can check the visa regulations for your nationality with the Tunisian authorities. You can also take a ferry from Marseille, Nice & Genoa directly to Tunis. This is a comfortable journey that can take up to 24 hours with the ferry companies including CTN, Corsica Linea, and Grimaldi Lines. The port of La Goulette/Halq al-Wad is just a short drive from the Taa Marbouta Language Centre. This is usually more expensive than flying but it does mean you can bring your car relatively easily.",

    desc: "Outside of class time, we help arrange travel and visits to all corners of the country. Tunisia is a diverse country with a beautiful coastline stretching from Cap Angela as the northernmost point in Africa to the Island of Djerba in the south. Tunisia’s interior regions of Kef and Beja are incredibly green, with magnificent hills stretching all the way to the border with Algeria. The Sahara desert slowly appears as you drive further south, and we can help you experience the best of oasis towns such as Tozeur, and native Amazigh/Berber villages in Tataouine, which is also of interest for Star Wars fans. Travel to these other cities can be done by car (the inter-city roads are very good), by train (quite cheap), by minibus or louage (cheap), or by bus (very cheap). We would suggest louage for most students as the best way to get around the country – just let us know what you are thinking and we will help you out!",

It is also safe, and women from around the world will feel quite relaxed wearing what they would at home here.",

Cars can easily be hired with international or foreign driving licences but the cost can be quite high; you can check with us for recommendations about car-hire companies. You can easily get around Tunis using taxis, collective taxis, and the metro, although we suggest using apps like Bolt if you are just arriving as this will make your life a lot easier.",
  },
  {
    desc: "Tunisia is mostly a cash-based economy and so you will generally not need to use credit and debit cards apart from for ATM withdrawals and at more upmarket shops and malls. ATMs are present all over the capital and throughout the country, although try not to run out of cash as machines sometimes will not accept certain cards.Some major supermarkets, such as Carrefour, will accept international bank cards.",

  {
    desc: "Tunisia is a safe country for the most part, despite the ongoing challenges faced by neighbouring Libya. There are some closed military zones several hours south of Tunis, such as the Jabal Chaambi region, where there has been terrorist activity in recent years. However, the capital itself is safe and the Taa Marbouta Language Centre is next door to the Presidential Palace and so could not be in a more secure place. In spite of the awkward ongoing political situation in Tunisia, life continues to go on as normal, although many Tunisians are finding the economic situation to be very challenging.",

This means that in addition to providing language education, we also set up internships or research opportunities for our students. This helps students take their first steps in the international arena, often their first experience of working abroad or in an international setting. For some people it may be their first time working in another language!",

There are innumerable non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working on every issue imaginable, from supporting the rights of female agricultural workers in the interior of the country to advocating for LGBT communities. There are many local development organisations, sports organisations, media outlets and investigative journalism outfits. While most work experience opportunities will be unpaid, there are some opportunities that will provide a modest stipend. Libyan civil society actors are also prevalent in Tunis and so there may also be opportunities for engagement with Libyan organisations as well.",

We will only move forward with searching for internship opportunities once programme fees have been paid. Should you not be satisfied with the first opportunity we find, we will carry out a second search to suit your needs and interests. In 2022 alone the Taa Marbouta Language Centre has found internships for several students coming from abroad in NGOs working on a variety of issues: women’s rights, social & economic research, communications & marketing, local development, and preserving cultural heritage.",

We have also connected students to opportunities where they have contributed to ongoing research on important topics such as migration from Tunisia.",

    desc: "With this support, the Taa Marbouta Language Centre is able to help students set themselves apart. If they can graduate university with strong language skills and international work experience, they will stand out from the crowd.
